Our team came up with the combined idea of making a button that multiplies onClick, and whose 'child-buttons' all have differing effects. My tasks: Wrote the user story as guideline for how the final site experience should look and feel like. Developed the 'water' and 'cat' buttons. Responsible for the site's design and fixing animations",
